# üß† CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python  
A collection of my solutions and implementations from Harvard's **renowned CS50 AI course**, exploring core concepts in traditional artificial intelligence.

> Topics covered include search, knowledge, uncertainty, optimization, learning, neaural networks and language. All are implemented entirely in Python.

## üìÅ Projects

| Project       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Degrees**   | Implements a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to determine the shortest path between actors through shared film appearances (from the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"). |
| **Tic-Tac-Toe** | Uses the **Minimax algorithm** to play perfectly in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, maximizing the AI's chance of winning or drawing. |
| **Knights**   | Applies **propositional logic** to solve logic puzzles involving knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie). |
| **Minesweeper** | Builds an AI agent that uses **logical inference** and **probabilistic reasoning** to safely navigate a Minesweeper grid. |
| **PageRank**  | Reimplements Google's **PageRank algorithm** using both sampling and iterative approaches to estimate page importance through link analysis. |
| **Hereditary** | _Coming soon_ |
| **Crossword** | _Coming soon_ |
